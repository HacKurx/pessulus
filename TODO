Open problems:
  * how do we unset a mandatory gconf key in the UI?

Before version 0.2:
  * HIG compliance :-)
  * LockdownApplier, to help integrate pessulus in sabayon

Future:
  * add more gconf keys
  * keep the safe protocols that were once enabled somewhere in gconf so they
    are easy to reenable
  * write help files

Problems waiting for a solution in another module:
  * why doesn't gconf immediately pick up the mandatory settings?
  * add --help, etc. in main.py
    => waiting for GOption wrapping in pygtk because we want the GTK+ option
       group
  * workaround in disabledapplets.py
    => waiting for bonobo_server_info_prop_lookup () to be wrapped in
       gnome-python
  * ugly workaround in disabledapplets.py
    => waiting for g_get_language_names () to be wrapped in pygtk
  * ugly workaround in lockdowngconfutils.py
    => waiting for gconf_engine_get_entry() to be wrapped in gnome-python
